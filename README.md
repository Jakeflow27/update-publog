About
=======
Builds a material database from public sources for use in MongoDB.
 This would have been much easier in python it seems. Originally created for 
 https://github.com/Jakeflow27/publog But I'm sure this might be useful for
 others.

# Install
    npm install Jakeflow27/update-publog --save

# Usage
    node update-publug.js //or
    
    var updater = require("update-publog");
    updater.update();
